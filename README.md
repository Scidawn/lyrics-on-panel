# Plasma6-Lyric-on-panel

> This widget is a fork of the great widget [Lyrics-on-Panel](https://github.com/KangweiZhu/lyrics-on-panel) by KangweiZhu. The original widget requires a lot of space on the panel.
> So, I decided to make a new widget that automatically splits the lyrics into multiple lines and displays them on the panel.
> Furthermore, I rearranged the layout of the widget to make it more compact.
> Finally, I aim to translate the Chinese comments into English, and make the widget more user-friendly.
> Hope you enjoy it!
> Last but not least, I would like to thank KangweiZhu for his great work!
> Long live the open-source community!
